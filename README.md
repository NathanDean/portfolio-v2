# Portfolio v2

## What

This is my current portfolio (the site you’re viewing). It’s built with React, using React Router and Material UI. On the backend, I’ve used Sanity v3 as a headless CMS, with the Orderable Document List extension.

## Why

I built my original portfolio using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express. I spent a lot of time on custom CSS and DOM manipulation to make the site responsive and create some simple animations. Although I was pleased with the design and execution, I came to realise that the site didn’t present information in the most user-friendly way, and wasn’t showcasing my skills with newer technologies.

With that in mind, I decided to create a new, simplified version of my portfolio, using up-to-date technologies and with information more accessible to users.

## How

To create a user-friendly design, I decided the site would have only two main pages – one with cards summarising each project, and another with information about me. There would then be a page outlining each project in more detail (like this one).

Each project summary contains a screenshot, to give viewers an immediate feel for the project, along with a short description, and buttons allowing users to easily view each project and its GitHub repo without having to navigate to another page first. The summary also lists the main technologies used, to give readers an overview of how the project was constructed.

For the front-end I decided to use React rather than vanilla JavaScript, making it easier to create a modern single page app with CSS-in-JS.

I considered using Node.js, Express and MongoDB for the back-end. However, I had been wanting to build a project with a headless CMS, and I decided that since I will be updating my portfolio regularly, it made sense to use one here.

## What I learnt

This was the first project I built using these technologies without following a tutorial. This meant that I worked out how to solve problems by reading the relevant docs and testing solutions myself, rather than having them explained to me. By doing this, I gained a far better understanding of how each technology worked, and ended up refactoring code as I went through when I realised there was a more efficient way to achieve my goals.

I found learning about Sanity Studio particularly fascinating, and was impressed by how easy and intuitive it was (after some initial learning) to customise the user interface. It’s clearly a powerful tool that I will use for future projects where managing content is an important consideration, particularly on projects intended for non-technical users.
